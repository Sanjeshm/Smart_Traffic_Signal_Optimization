# Smart Traffic Signal Optimization üö¶

This project is a smart traffic management system designed to optimize traffic flow at an intersection using real-time vehicle detection. It combines a Pygame-based traffic simulation with an AI-powered vehicle detection module (YOLOv5) to dynamically adjust signal timings based on traffic density.

The core idea is to reduce unnecessary waiting times and improve overall traffic efficiency by giving longer green lights to lanes with heavier congestion.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Real-time Traffic Simulation**: A visual simulation of a four-way intersection built with Pygame, featuring multiple lanes and vehicle types.
* **AI-based Vehicle Detection**: Uses the YOLOv5 model to detect and classify vehicles (cars, buses, trucks, etc.) in images or video streams.
* **Dynamic Signal Control**: The simulation includes logic to adjust green light duration based on the number and type of vehicles waiting in each lane.
* **Multi-Vehicle Support**: The simulation differentiates between cars, bikes, buses, trucks, and rickshaws, each with unique properties like speed and size, for more realistic traffic flow calculations.
* **Modular & Extensible**: The detection and simulation components are separate, allowing for easy updates and integration.

## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized into several key folders and scripts:



```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ darkflow/            # Source code for the Darkflow framework
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/              # Assets for the Pygame simulation (vehicles, background)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output_images/       # Default directory for saved detection results
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_images/         # Directory for input images for vehicle detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ flow                 # Script associated with Darkflow
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setup.py             # Installation script for the Darkflow module
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simulation.py        # Main script to run the Pygame traffic simulation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vd.py                # Script to perform vehicle detection using YOLOv5
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yolov5su.pt          # Pre-trained YOLOv5 model weights
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd Smart_Traffic_Signal_Optimization
```

**2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

**3. Install Dependencies**
Install all the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Build the Darkflow Module**
This project includes a legacy `darkflow` module that requires a manual build step for its Cython extensions.
```bash
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

**5. Download Model Weights**
The `yolov5su.pt` file should be in the root directory. If not, download it or use the `ultralytics` library to fetch it automatically on the first run of `vd.py`.

## üöÄ How to Run

There are two main components to this project: the vehicle detection script and the traffic simulation.

### 1. Vehicle Detection

The `vd.py` script runs the YOLOv5 model to detect vehicles in images.

* Place any images you want to test inside the `test_images/` folder.
* Run the script from the terminal:
    ```bash
    python vd.py
    ```
* The script will process each image, and the annotated results will be saved in the `output_images/` directory.

### 2. Traffic Simulation

The `simulation.py` script launches the Pygame-based traffic simulation.

* Run the script from the terminal:
    ```bash
    python simulation.py
    ```
* A Pygame window will open, displaying the intersection. The simulation will start automatically, generating vehicles and controlling traffic signals.
* The console will print the status of the traffic signals and vehicle counts.
